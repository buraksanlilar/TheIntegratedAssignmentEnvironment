# Integrated Assignment Environment (IAE)

**IAE** is a desktop application designed to automate the **import**, **compilation**, **execution**, and **evaluation** of programming assignments submitted by students. Developed using **Electron**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, it offers a clean and efficient interface for instructors to manage configurations, process student submissions, and view evaluation reports.
